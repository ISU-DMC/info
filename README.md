# [The Data Mining Cup](http://www.data-mining-cup.de/en/)

The Data Mining Cup is an international competition hosted by a German analytics company, [prudsys AG](http://www.prudsys.de/en/). In 2015 almost 200 teams from about 150 universities in 48 countries took part in the competition. The best teams were invited to Berlin for the [awards ceremony](http://www.data-mining-cup.de/en/wettbewerb/preistraeger.html) at the [prudsys personalization summit (for retail)](http://www.prudsys.de/en/summit.html).

Iowa State has a rich history of performing very well in DMC. Rick Zhou led ISU to fifth place in the 2013 competition, Cory Lanker led to first place in 2014, and Ian Mouzzon led to 2nd and 3rd place in 2015.

### Using GitHub

If you are not familiar with Git and GitHub, please read through the following links:

If you are used to working from the command line then Git should be easy for you. If not, there is a great GUI for GitHub that is supported by both Mac and Windows: [https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/).

There is also a YouTube Channel dedicating to using GitHub: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0lo9MOBetEHhfG9vJzVCTiDYcbhAiEqL](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0lo9MOBetEHhfG9vJzVCTiDYcbhAiEqL).

Keep in mind that GitHub is not designed to be a database, and generally the size of a repository is capped at 1 GB. However, we will be using the Git Large File Storage (Git LFS) system which is supported by GitHub in order to store datasets. With Git LFS we get up to 50 GB of storage which should be much more than enough for the competition. Using Git LFS is extremely easy. You can read about it here: [Getting started with Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/?utm_source=github_site&utm_medium=billing_settings_link&utm_campaign=gitlfs).
Remember, **please do not ever push large data files unless they are tracked by Git LFS**.
