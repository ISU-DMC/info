# [The Data Mining Cup](http://www.data-mining-cup.de/en/)

The Data Minig Cup is an international competition hosted by a German analytics company, [prudsys AG](http://www.prudsys.de/en/). In 2015 almost 200 teams from about 150 universities in 48 countries took part in the competition. The best teams were invited to Berlin for the [awards ceremony](http://www.data-mining-cup.de/en/wettbewerb/preistraeger.html) at the [prudsys personalization summit (for retail)](http://www.prudsys.de/en/summit.html).

Iowa State has a rich history of performing very well in DMC. Rick Zhou led ISU to fifth place in the 2013 competition, Cory Lanker led to first place in 2014, and Ian Mouzzon led to 2nd and 3rd place in 2015.
